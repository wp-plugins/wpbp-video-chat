== Description ==

TinyChat full screen video chat for WordPress and BuddyPress,
This also has YouTube/SoundCloud for all chatters and now has smileys enabled using my embed file,
This now requires users to be logged in to the wordpress site to chat (This was a requested update).


== Installation ==

This will automatically create the page and install the short code with link *domain name/chatroom*, If it does not then please read the rest below.

Simply use shortcode [tinychat_page] in a page, you may need to remove footer as some will show in front of the chat screen.
This also uses my modified Tinychat embed file, This get's updated externally so you'll never need to update it.
If you want to use Tinychats original then you'll have to change the embed file url to http://tinychat.com/embed/chat.js.
Some themes may have issues with keyboard shortcuts, Especially for those that use jetpack, You'll have to disable the admin navbar from your frontend by adding 
// Remove Admin Bar Front End
add_filter('show_admin_bar', '__return_false');
to your themes functions.php file.

== Screenshots ==

* TinyChat load screen, Users of TinyChat will notice the colour change.
* Once loaded you'll have to enter a name.
* This is showing the YouTube/Soundcloud buttons.
* Both show popups which you just enter what you'd like to search.
* This is how it displays with both YouTube and Soundcloud.
* Click this to maximize the video size, This also works when you're on camera.
* This is how it looks using the larger video's.

== Notes ==

This is full screen video chat that is used on TinyChat, This will use your domain name as the chatroom name,
This way it'll never conflict with other rooms on TinyChat,
If anyone else requires another feature or has an idea for me to implement, Then open a support ticket with the relevant information.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

* Q. Can I use this if I'm not logged in?
* A. No!, I removed that feature due to a few requests, You can simply allow guest access by removing. * }
function wp_show_wordpress_chat() {
	$current_user = wp_get_current_user();
	if($current_user->ID == 0) {
		echo('<b>You are not logged in, please login before trying to chat!</b>' );
		return;
	} *

* Q. The chat is not loading for me.
* A. Check to see if you have the Adobe flash player installed (http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player.html) and JavaScript enabled in your browser.

* Q. How do I add it to my blog/website?
* A. Just go to the backend and on appearance select menus, From there you can add your page, It'll be *chatroom* by default.

* Q. I'm having issues with my wordpress keyboard shortcuts affecting my chat, It's not allowing me to use certain letters.
* A. The fix for this is to disable the Admin navbar on your frontend only, to do this add * // Remove Admin Bar Front End
add_filter('show_admin_bar', '__return_false'); * to you funtions.php file in your themes folder.
